A reverse challenge: the function takes a decimal value as input and then converts it to Gray code. Taking this value and treating it as if it were binary, it will then be converted back to decimal and returned.
For example, 13 will be converted to its binary equivalent 1101. This will then be turned into Gray code; 1011, then read back as 11 (decimal).

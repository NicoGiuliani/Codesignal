If you have a task that you need to complete on a regular basis, you can set it up in Asana as a recurring task. This allows you to schedule the task to repeat on specific days of the week every k weeks.

For instance, you could set up a recurring task that reminds you to call your sister on Tuesday and Friday every 3 weeks. You set up the first instance of the task for Tuesday, March 1. The next instance will fall on Friday, March 4. The third instance will fall 3 weeks later on Tuesday, March 22, the fourth instance will fall on Friday, March 25, the fifth instance will fall on Tuesday, April 12, and so on.

Given a firstDate that represents the day your recurring task becomes active, an array daysOfTheWeek that indicates which days of the week the task should occur on, and a number k that represents the interval between weeks on which the task occurs, return an array that contains the first n dates on which the task is scheduled.
